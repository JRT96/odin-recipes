            <h2>A pupusa is a thick griddle cake or flatbread from El Salvador and Honduras, made with cornmeal or rice flour, similar to the Venezuelan and Colombian arepa. In El Salvador, it has been declared the national dish and has a specific day to celebrate it.</h2>
            <h3>You can purchase pre-made chicharron at specialty markets, however this recipe tastes just like it. I also make the salsa roja and curtido ahead of time (the salsa freezes very well, and the curtido can stay in the fridge at least a week).</h3>

            <li>½ cup of vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Combine tomato sauce, water, cilantro, green bell pepper, onion, crushed garlic, bouillon cube, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes. Let salsa roja cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fill a blender halfway with the salsa roja. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with remaining salsa roja. Return to saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes more stirring occasionally. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour, and refrigerate.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place cabbage and carrots in a large bowl. Add 4 cups boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well. Mix in vinegar, scallions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Chill curtido until serving.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until almost fully cooked and not yet crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon and grease (if desired) to a food processor. Add tomatoes, quartered green bell pepper, Monterey Jack cheese, and minced garlic. Puree and season the chicharron with salt.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mix masa harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet towel.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat 1/2 cup of oil over a large skilklet on medium-high heat</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with your thumb; put a small amount of chicharron inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands into a thick tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining dough and chicharron.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve each pupusa topped with 2 tablespoons of curtido and 1 tablespoon of salsa roja.</li>
            </ul>
